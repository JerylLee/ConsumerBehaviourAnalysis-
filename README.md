Business Problem:
KOKOLU wants to understand their customer's behavior better to improve their sales, customer experience, and marketing strategies. The company is experiencing a high rate of cart abandonment and wants to identify the reasons for this, as well as finding ways to increase customer loyalty and retention.

Solution:
To solve this problem, we will perform an analysis of the company's ecommerce customer behavior. The analysis will include identifying patterns and trends in customer behavior, examining the customer journey, and identifying areas of improvement. We will also use data to determine the reasons behind cart abandonment and identify ways to reduce it.

Data Analysis:
The data analysis will include the following steps:

- Data Collection: Collecting data from the company's ecommerce platform, including customer demographics, browsing and purchase history, and cart abandonment data.

- Data Cleaning: Cleaning the collected data to ensure that it is accurate, complete, and consistent.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting EDA to identify patterns and trends in customer behavior, examine the customer journey, and identify areas of improvement.

- Cart Abandonment Analysis: Analyzing the data to determine the reasons behind cart abandonment and identify ways to reduce it.

- Customer Segmentation: Segmenting customers based on their behavior and preferences to identify customer segments with high potential for sales and retention.


Deliverables:

- User Report Analysis, including insights on customer behavior, cart abandonment, and customer segmentation.
- Recommendations for improving customer experience, increasing sales, and reducing cart abandonment, based on the data analysis and predictive models.
- Visualizations and dashboards to help the company monitor and track customer behavior and performance metrics.
